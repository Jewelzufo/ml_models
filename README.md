# ml_models

#This repository contains a simple machine learning algorithm implemented in Python using a linear regression model.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`.
3. Run the `machine_learning_algorithm.py` script to see the linear regression model in action.

## Files

- `machine_learning_algorithm.py`: Python script containing the machine learning algorithm code.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.

## Sample Data

- Input Data (X):
[[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]]

- Target Output (y):
  [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]

  ## Graph

The script generates a graph displaying the data points, the linear regression model, and the prediction.
